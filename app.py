            ### **Eco-Friendly Intra-Campus Monorail System Design:**  
            This project focused on the conceptual design of an eco-friendly intra-campus monorail system for WPS, aimed at enhancing transport efficiency and sustainability. As the project lead, I conducted a comprehensive route analysis to determine the most effective layout, prioritising accessibility, environmental impact, and integration with existing campus infrastructure.

            A key aspect of the design process involved engineering high-capacity carriages tailored for optimal passenger experience. This included advanced HVAC systems to ensure energy-efficient climate control and specialised accommodations for elderly passengers, improving accessibility and inclusivity. Additionally, sustainability was at the forefront of the project, with careful material selection and energy-efficient propulsion methods incorporated into the design.

            While the system remained at the design stage, the project provided valuable insights into sustainable transport solutions and the complexities of large-scale infrastructure planning. Through extensive research, modelling, and iterative refinement, I developed a concept that balanced efficiency, environmental responsibility, and user comfort. This experience reinforced my expertise in transport design, sustainable engineering, and strategic planning for future mobility solutions.

            In this project, I led a team of engineers in the development of an innovative gymnastics stamp bug and rover, designed to merge engineering with artistic performance. This unique system aimed to enhance gymnastic routines through synchronised movement and visual effects. To achieve this, I designed and programmed LED arrays that operated in perfect synchrony with music, creating dynamic light displays that complemented the choreography.

            A key technical challenge involved ensuring precise timing and responsiveness of the LEDs to the audio input. This required extensive testing and refinement of control algorithms to achieve a seamless visual effect. Additionally, I leveraged Siemens NX to introduce eco-friendly and sustainable modifications, ensuring that the final design adhered to environmentally conscious engineering principles.

            The project resulted in a novel robotic system capable of augmenting gymnastic performances through intelligent visual synchronisation. While the system successfully enhanced the aesthetic appeal of performances, ongoing development could further optimise power efficiency and expand its range of interactive features. This project not only strengthened my expertise in robotics, embedded systems, and sustainable design but also provided me with valuable leadership experience in multidisciplinary engineering.

            ### **Project Overview: Fibre Optic Sagnac Interferometer for High-Precision Rotation Measurement:**  
            In this project, I developed a system based on a fibre optic Sagnac interferometer, designed to measure axial rotation with exceptional precision. Rotation sensors are becoming increasingly integral to many of the technologies we rely on in our daily lives, and this project aimed to enhance the accuracy of such measurements. To achieve this, I conducted a comprehensive review of existing sensors and literature related to interferometers. I also utilised an oscilloscope to capture and analyse data, which was then used to validate the systemâ€™s performance and ensure the projectâ€™s objectives were met.  
            
            A critical aspect of this project involved the precise setup of the interferometer and the complex calculations required to determine the roll angle. By leveraging the Sagnac effect, the interferometer successfully detected angular velocity, which was subsequently integrated to derive the roll angle.  
            
            The results from multiple tests demonstrated that the interferometer was capable of accurately recording intensity and, through the application of refined equations, calculating angular velocity to a high degree of precision. However, while the system effectively measured angular distance travelled, it was unable to determine the direction of rotation. As a result, the interferometer recorded angular distance rather than true angular displacement (roll).  
            
            Overall, this project not only reinforced my expertise in optical sensing systems and data analysis but also provided me with valuable experience in designing and optimising precision measurement instruments.
